#Code Shameless

Like so many things, Code Shameless started because of a question: How can a developer who wants to work with women developers find them? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 29.7% of all employees working in "Computer and Software" services, though it's not clear from that figure how many write code. One thing we do know: there is no parity yet. For now, self-teaching and bootcamps appear to be the way more people — especially women — are learning to code. Tutorials and fast-track intensives get us past the fundamentals. But then what?
As we learn, we all go through a period of writing awkward code while we figure things out. And we all get stuck. But we don't have to struggle alone and afraid.	We created Code Shameless to help developers level up in a healthy environment. And to make sure that happens, Code Shameless has three rules:

- <strong>Be kind.</strong> There are people with feelings reading what you write.
- <strong>Be civil.</strong>
- <strong>Code shameless.</strong> We all have times when we write code that borks or embarrasses us because we just want it to work. And that's OK.
	

If you're stuck, post your code and explain what you meant for the code to do. And if you can help, do so.
Code is awkward. You don't have to be. Code Shameless.
