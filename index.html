	<h1>Code Shameless</h1>
	<p>Like so many things, Code Shameless started because of a question: How can a developer who wants to work with women developers find them?</p>
	<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 29.7% of all employees working in "Computer and Software" services, though it's not clear from that figure how many write code.</p>
	<p>One thing we do know: there is no parity yet. For now, self-teaching and bootcamps appear to be the way more people — especially women — are learning to code. Tutorials and fast-track intensives get us past the fundamentals. But then what?</p>
	<p>As we learn, we all go through a period of writing awkward code while we figure things out. And we all get stuck. But we don't have to struggle alone and afraid.</p>
	<p>We created Code Shameless to help developers level up in a healthy environment. And to make sure that happens, Code Shameless has three rules:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Be kind.</strong> There are people with feelings reading what you write.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Be civil.</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Code shameless.</strong> We all have times when we write code that borks or embarrasses us because <em>we just want it to work</em>. And that's OK.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you're stuck, post your code and explain what you meant for the code to do. And if you can help, do so.</p>
	<p>Code is awkward. You don't have to be. Code Shameless.</p>
